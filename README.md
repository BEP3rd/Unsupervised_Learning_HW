In this homework, I analyzed a set of cryptocurrencies\
I prepared the crypto data for analysis by making sure all the currencies of interest were traded and that they are mined.\
Then prepared the data by making all attributes numeric so the algorithm could understand.\
I then used k-Means cluster analysis to determine whether or not the currencies could be classified into sets.\

My conclusion is that there is no meaningful clustering of coins, and that a different method of classificaiton be used.
